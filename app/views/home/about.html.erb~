      <p>The idea for <span class="smwText">SwapMyWhip.com</span> came to me out of pure frustration. I was in search of an alternative to the traditional methods of selling and buying vehicles. Buying a new car was always fun and exciting, but selling a car - ugh....I always dreaded that part of the process.
      </p>
      <p>I'd noticed ads on occasion for vehicle owners wishing to trade, but never found a site that was well organized and devoted to trading. And, working with dealerships and dealer websites - well, I never felt that I was getting good value for my trade in.
			</p>
			<p>So, the concept was born......
			</p>
			<p>I set out to put together a team of professionals - from programmers to graphic artists, and we collaborated on the project for the better part of a year, to ensure that every detail was perfect.
