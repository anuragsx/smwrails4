  <li><strong>Buying and Selling Vehicles</strong></li>

<p>Swap My Whip.com is a vehicle listing and information service that brings  together buyers and sellers. Information about a particular vehicle is supplied  by the seller, not by Swap My Whip.com. The price and other terms of any sale  remain subject to direct negotiation between the buyer and the seller. The  prices listed by sellers on Swap My Whip.com are determined by the sellers and may or may not include regulatory taxes or surcharges, including but not limited to sales tax, finance  charges, title fees, license fees, dealer documentary fees, emission testing or any other regulatory fees.  Swap My Whip.com is not an advisory service for which regulatory fees may or may not apply to a particular sales transaction.

<br />
	Swap My Whip.com can not verify nor guarantee the information provided by the seller is accurate.

Therefore, it is mutually incumbent upon both the seller and the buyer that all details associated with their transaction are independently verified.  As such, Swap My Whip.com is not responsible for any misrepresentations, misunderstandings, failure of either the seller or buyer to consummate the sale, or any other false or misleading information provided by either the seller or the buyer of any particular sales transaction.  Swap My Whip.com encourages all users of their services to do so with healthey skepticism and report any sellers or buyers that provide false or misleading information.<br />
  <br />
  Swap My Whip.com reserves the right to screen some, or all listings and email exchanges before posting the information publicly. This screening may result in delays of publicly posting your information.<br />
  <br />
  When offering a vehicle for trade/sale through Swap My Whip.com, the seller guarantees that he or she is prepared to sell that vehicle at the price and the terms listed.  Additionally, when posting a vehicle or goods and services on Swap My Whip.com, the seller also guarantees that he or she has legal possession of the actual vehicle listed and the ability to legally transfer title.<br />
  <br />
	Swap My Whip.com ads are available <b>only to private traders/sellers</b> who want to list their vehicles for trade/sale.  To list a vehicle for sale on Swap My Whip.com, traders/sellers  are required to provide currently accurate identifying and contact information.

  <br />
  Swap My Whip.com ads shall not be  used to advertise more than one vehicle per ad purchased, regardless of ad  duration. For this reason, sellers cannot edit their vehicle's Year, Make, Model or VIN once they have purchased their ad.<br />
  <br />

Additionally, any party wishing to inquire about advertising opportunities on Swap My Whip.com, please contact us at <a href="mailto:service@swapmywhip.com">service@swapmywhip.com</a>.  By listing  your vehicle on the Swap My Whip.com website, you represent that you are not a  motor vehicle dealer, that you are not listing a vehicle for sale in your  capacity as an owner, employee or representative of a dealer, and that neither  you, nor anyone acting on your behalf will list more than three vehicles for  sale simultaneously. Swap My Whip.com  reserves the right to deny use of this website  to anyone who does not comply with these requirements or who otherwise uses our  website in an inappropriate manner.<br />
  <br />
  Because we can't monitor every transaction originating through a listing  on Swap My Whip.com, we reserve the right to perform random quality assurance tests to confirm the accuracy of the information and terms provided by sellers and buyers.  As such, if Swap My Whip.com determines that a seller is engaging in &quot;bait and switch&quot; or other unfair  or deceptive practices, Swap My Whip.com reserves the right to deny that seller  use of the Swap My Whip.com service indefinitely.<br />
  <br />
  By placing an ad through Swap My Whip.com, you explicitly agree to pay Swap My Whip.com all fees specified, regardless of whether or not you successfully sell or trade the vehicle specified.
