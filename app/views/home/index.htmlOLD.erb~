			<p>Utilizing an “apples-to-apples” approach, Swap My Whip provides users with a fair trade environment where they can list the vehicle(s) they have to offer, and create a “wish list” of vehicles they’d be willing to trade for. By limiting transactions to private parties only, Swap My Whip bypasses the overpriced auto market, and dealers with only their own interests in mind, and allows users to conduct swaps on a level playing field they establish themselves. If you’re ready to get the most for your money, give us a try!</p>
			<p>Swap My Whip was founded by a group of individuals who were tired of paying more for less. By creating a fair trade market, Swap My Whip offers its users the chance to get exactly what they want for a price they’re willing to pay. </p>
