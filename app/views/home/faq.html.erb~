			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: How does this site work?<br />
									A:</strong> <br />
									(1) Register<br /> 
									(2) Create a listing for the vehicle you own<br />
									(3) Add the vehicle that you desire to your Wishlist page<br />
									(4) Search for the desired vehicle you have just added to your Wishlist. If a "Perfect Swap" is available, it will be displayed as such in your search results. If not, the search results will display the vehicles you searched for, but they will not qualify as a "Perfect Swap". You can search through these listings, and email the owner to see if he/she might be interested in swapping for your vehicle. Having your desired vehicle displayed on your Wishlist will enable you to be notified when a "Perfect Swap" is available in the future. When a Perfect Swap is found, simply work out the details of your transaction with the other owner. There will possibly be a difference in value that needs to be addressed. Maybe a loan payoff as well. Work out your financial details, and use a reputable service to exchange funds. If you have no vehicle to swap, keep in mind that many owners will gladly entertain an offer to purchase outright.
